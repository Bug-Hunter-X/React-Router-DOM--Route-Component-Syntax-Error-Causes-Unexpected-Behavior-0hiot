# React Router DOM: Route Component Syntax Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router DOM v6 where a syntax error in a route component's render function can lead to unexpected behavior.  The error isn't immediately obvious and can be tricky to track down.

## Bug Description
A simple syntax error, such as a missing closing tag in a component rendered by a route, doesn't result in the expected error message or prevent the application from rendering.  Instead, the application might render incompletely or exhibit other strange behaviors. The React Router doesn't directly handle or report these kinds of syntax errors within route components. 

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior on the `/about` route.
